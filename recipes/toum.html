    <h3>Toum! Creamy Middle Eastern Garlic Sauce
    </h3>
    <p>Toum is a rich, creamy, and intensely garlicky Middle Eastern sauce that pairs beautifully with grilled meats, roasted vegetables, or even as a spread for sandwiches.</p>
    <h4>Classic Hummus Recipe</h4>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>3 cups neutral oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cold water</li>
    </ul></p><br>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><h4><strong>Prepare the Garlic:</strong></h4>Add garlic and salt to a food processor. Pulse until the garlic is finely minced, scraping down the sides as needed.</li>
        <li><h4><strong>Start the Emulsion:</strong></h4>With the processor running, slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup of oil, followed by 1 tsp of lemon juice. Continue alternating between oil and lemon juice, little by little, to avoid breaking the emulsion.</li>
        <li><h4><strong>Add Water:</strong></h4>If the sauce starts to look too thick or the garlic isnâ€™t blending smoothly, add a tablespoon of cold water to help with the consistency.</li>
        <li><h4><strong>Finish the Sauce:</strong></h4>Continue adding the oil and lemon juice until the full amounts are used. The mixture should turn into a creamy, fluffy sauce. Serve: Once the toum is ready, transfer it to a jar or bowl. Serve it with grilled meats, shawarma, kebabs, or as a dip for veggies and bread.</li>
        <li><h4><strong>Serve:</strong></h4>Transfer to a bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and garnish with paprika or parsley. Serve with pita, crackers, or veggies.</li>
